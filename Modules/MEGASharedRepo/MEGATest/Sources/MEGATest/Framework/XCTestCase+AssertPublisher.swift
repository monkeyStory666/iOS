    /// This method allows for executing an asynchronous action that may throw an error before asserting the publisher's output. The `handler` closure is used to perform custom assertions on the emitted value.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - publisher: The publisher to observe.
    ///   - action: An optional asynchronous throwing action to perform before waiting for the publisher's output.
    ///   - handler: A closure that performs custom assertions on the emitted value.
    ///   - timeout: The maximum time to wait for the publisher to emit a value.
    ///   - file: The file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this method was called.
    ///   - line: The line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this method was called.
    ///
    /// Example Usage:
    /// ```
    /// let myPublisher = Just(5).eraseToAnyPublisher()
    /// await assertOnNextEmit(
    ///     from: myPublisher,
    ///     when: {
