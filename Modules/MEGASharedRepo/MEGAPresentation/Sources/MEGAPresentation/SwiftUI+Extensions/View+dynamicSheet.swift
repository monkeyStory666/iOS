    /// Dynamically presents either a full-screen cover or a sheet based on an optional value.
    ///
    /// This function enhances SwiftUI's presentation functionality by allowing the dynamic choice between
    /// a full-screen cover or a sheet presentation, dependent on the `isFullScreen` flag and the presence
    /// of an optional value. It is particularly useful for adaptive UIs where the presentation style may need
    /// to change based on device capabilities or user preferences.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - isFullScreen: A Boolean flag to determine the presentation style. `true` for a full-screen cover, `false` for a sheet. Defaults to false but always true for Mac Catalyst environments.
    ///   - optionalValue: A binding to an optional value. The presentation is triggered when this value becomes non-nil.
    ///   - isMacCatalyst: A flag that indicates if the current OS is Mac Catalyst.
    ///   - onDismiss: An optional closure executed when the presentation is dismissed.
    ///   - content: A closure returning the content of the presentation, taking a non-optional binding of the unwrapped value.
    /// - Returns: A view that conditionally presents a full-screen cover or a sheet based on the existence of an optional value and the `isFullScreen` flag.
    ///
    /// # Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// struct ExampleView: View {
    ///     @State private var optionalData: SomeDataType?
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         // Some view content
    ///         .dynamicSheet(isFullScreen: false, unwrap: $optionalData) { dataBinding in
